    <h1> This Web page is about me, Kate</h1></p>
    <h2>I created this page with a large script. Three JavaScript <strong>prompts</strong> ask the user questions to determine how well you know me.</h2>
    <h3>Then, answers are displayed with a response that is a JavaScript <strong>alert</strong>.</p>
      <h4>I learned the word concatenates to string together my alerts and those plusses are tricky!</h4>

    <p><h2><strong>About Me</h2></strong></p>
    <p>My name is <em>Kate</em> and I am making a career shift after a decade plus working in natural resource conservation. I want to learn to code to enhance my skill set and challenge my mind. I love to solve puzzles, read trashy romance books, hike in the mountains with my son and husband, and cook for my family.
